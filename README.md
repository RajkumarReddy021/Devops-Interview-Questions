### 1.What is the difference between a git pull and a git fetch?
git pull and git fetch are two distinct commands in Git that serve different purposes, primarily related to updating a local repository with changes from a remote repository  
git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge. It retrieves data from the remote repository and automatically merges it into the local branch.   
git fetch is used to retrieve data from remote repositories, but it does not automatically merge the data into the local branch. It only downloads the data and stores it in the local repository as a separate branch, which means the developer must manually merge the fetched data with the remote branch.

### 2. Is it possible to move or copy Jenkins from one server to another? How?
Yes, one can copy the Jenkins jobs directory from the old server to the new one. To move a job from one Jenkins installation to another, one can simply copy the required job directory.   
Another method is to create a clone of an existing job directory with a different name. Another way is to rename an existing job by renaming the directory. However, in this method, one needs to change any other job calling the renamed job.

### 3. Explain how you will handle sensitive data in DevOps.
Handling sensitive data in DevOps requires a robust approach to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Here are some steps that can be taken to handle sensitive data in DevOps:   
- Identify and classify sensitive data: The first step is to identify what data is sensitive and then classify it based on its level of sensitivity. This will help determine the appropriate measures to be taken to protect it.   
- Implement access controls: Access controls should be put in place to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. This includes implementing strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and limiting access to sensitive data on a need-to-know basis.   
- Encrypt data: Sensitive data should be encrypted in transit and at rest. This helps protect the data from being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties.   
Use secure communication channels: Communication channels to transfer sensitive data should be secured using encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS.   
- Implement auditing and logging: Audit logs should be kept to monitor who has accessed sensitive data and what actions were taken. This helps detect and respond to any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.   
Conduct regular security assessments: Regular security assessments should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks. This helps ensure that the security measures put in place are effective and up to date.


### 4. Describe Blue-Green deployments in DevOps. How does Blue/Green and Rolling deployment differ in Kubernetes?
By definition, blue-green deployment is a code release model comprising two different yet identical environments simultaneously existing. Here, the traffic is moved from one environment to the other to let the updated environment go into production, while the older one can be retired via a continuous cycle.  

Blue-green deployment is a widely-used technique in DevOps that companies adopt to roll out new software updates or designs without causing downtime. It is usually implemented for web app maintenance and requires two identically running applications with the same hardware environments established for a single application. The active version is the blue one, which serves the end users, and the inactive one is green.   

Blue/Green deployment uses two environments with the new version in one environment while the current version runs in the other. Traffic is switched when the new version is ready. Rolling deployment updates pods incrementally, replacing old versions with new while maintaining availability.   

### 5. Describe a multi-stage Dockerfile, and why is it useful?
A multi-stage Dockerfile allows multiple build stages within a single Dockerfile. Each stage can use a different base image, and only required artifacts are carried forward. It reduces the final image size, improves build time, and enhances security.

### 6.Explain Ansible Playbooks. Write a simple Ansible playbook to install and start Nginx.
Ansible’s Playbooks are its language for configuration, deployment, and orchestration. These Playbooks can define a policy that a team would want its remote systems to establish, or a group of steps in a general IT procedure.  
Playbooks are human-readable and follow a basic text language. At the basic level, these can also be used for the configuration and deployment management of remote machines.

### 7. Explain the concept of the term "cloud-native".
The term ‘cloud native’ is used to describe any application built to reside in the cloud from its very beginning. Cloud-native comprises cloud technologies such as container
orchestrators, auto-scaling, and microservices.   

### 8. How can you get a list of every ansible_variable?
By default, Ansible collects ‘facts’ about machines under management. You can access these facts in templates and Playbooks. To check the full list of all the facts available about a particular machine, run the setup module as an ad-hoc action using this:
Ansible -m setup hostname
Using this will print out a complete list of all facts available for a particular host.

### 10. Give a complete overview of Jenkins architecture.
Jenkins uses a Master/Slave architecture for distributed build management. This has two components: the Jenkins server, and the Jenkins node/build/slave server. Here’s what the architecture looks like:

- The Jenkins server is a war file-powered web dashboard. Using this, you can configure projects/jobs. However, the build takes place in the slave/nodes. By default, only one nodes/slave runs on the Jenkins server, but you can add more using a username, IP address, and password through the ssh/jnlp/webstart.
- The key Jenkins server is the master, whose job is to manage the scheduling of build jobs, deploying builds to slaves for execution, monitoring slaves, and recording and presenting build results. In a distributed architecture, a Jenkins master can also execute build jobs by itself.
- As for the slaves, their task is to do as per their configurations in the Jenkins server, which includes executing build jobs sent by the master. Teams can also configure projects to continuously run on specific slave machines or a particular type of slave machines or just let Jenkins select the next available slave.

### 11. How can you ensure minimum or zero downtime when updating a live heavy-traffic site
#### Before deploying on a production environment
- Rigorously testing the new changes and ensuring they work in a test environment almost similar to the production system.
- Running automation of test cases, if possible.
- Building an automated sanity testing script that can be run on production without impacting real data. These are usually read-only test cases, and depending on the application needs, developers can add more cases here.
- Creating scripts for manual tasks, if possible, avoiding human errors during the day of deployment.
- Testing the scripts to ensure they work properly within a non-production environment.
- Keeping the build artifacts ready, such as the database scripts, application deployment files, configuration files, etc.
- Rehearsing deployment, where the developers deploy in a non-production environment almost identical to the production environment.
- Creating and maintaining a checklist of to-do tasks on deployment day.
#### During deployment
- Using the green-blue deployment approach to avoid down-time risk.
- Maintaining a backup of current data/site to rollback when necessary.
- Implementing sanity test cases before running depth testing.
#### 12. How can you create a backup and copy file in Jenkins?
This is a rather simple DevOps interview question. To create a backup, you would need to periodically backup the JENKINS_HOME directory. This directory houses all the build configurations, the slave configurations, and the build history.   
To backup the Jenkins setup, you would simply need to copy the directory. Furthermore, a job directory can also be copied to replicate or clone a job or rename the directory itself.   
Additionally, you can also use the "Thin Backup" plugin or other backup plugins to automate the backup process and ensure that you have the latest backup available in case of any failure.

### 13. List the ways a build can be run or scheduled in Jenkins.
- Using source code management commits
- After completing other builds in Jenkins
- Scheduling the build to run at a specified time in Jenkins
- Sending manual build requests
- 
  ### 14. Write a simple Jenkins pipeline script to build and deploy a Docker container.

  ### 15. How to ensure security in Jenkins? What are the three security mechanisms Jenkins can use to authenticate a user?
  ##### The following steps can be taken to secure Jenkins:
- Ensuring that ‘global security’ is switched on.
- Ensuring that Jenkins is integrated with the organization’s user directory using the appropriate plugins.
- Automating the process of setting privileges or rights in Jenkins using custom version-controlled scripts.
- Ensuring that the matrix or Project matrix is enabled for fine-tuning access.
- Periodically running security audits on Jenkins folders or data and limiting physical access to them.
  ##### The three security mechanisms Jenkins can use to authenticate a user are:
- Jenkins utilizes internal databases to store user credentials and data responsible for authentication.
- Jenkins can use the LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) server to authenticate users as well.
- Teams can also configure Jenkins to use the authentication mechanism used by the deployed application server.
